                  <ul class="u-text u-text-2">
                    <li>The guitar is the world’s second most popular musical instrument, after the piano, and has evolved tremendously over centuries. </li>
                    <li>The word “guitar” was adopted into English from the Spanish word “guitarra” in the 1600s.</li>
                    <li>The oldest guitars came from Persia (modern day Iran), about 3,500 years ago, and were called “Tanbur”. </li>
                    <li>The world’s smallest guitar was made at Cornell University in New York. It is 10 micrometers long (1 micrometer is 1-millionth of a meter) with strings 50 nanometers (100 atoms) wide. </li>
                    <li>The design and dimensions of the modern guitar were established by Spanish guitarist Antonio Torres Jurado. </li>
                    <li>There is a man-made forest in Argentina that is in the shape of a guitar, planted by a farmer named Pedro Martin Ureta. It is located in the fertile “Pampas” agricultural region of Argentina and is made up of over 7,000 cypress and eucalyptus trees. </li>
                    <li>The most expensive guitar ever sold was Fender’s “Reach Out to Asia” Stratocaster that raised funds for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami &amp; Earthquake, and was signed by 19 professional musicians like Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Mick Jagger, and David Gilmour. The guitar sold for $2.7 million at auction. </li>
                    <li>The Fender factory makes over 90,000 guitar strings a day, that amounts to over 20,000 miles of string per year, enough to circle the Earth. </li>
                    <li>The longest marathon playing guitar is 114 hours, 6 minutes and 30 seconds and was achieved by David Browne at the Temple Bar Pub in Dublin, Ireland from June 12-17th, 2011. He played a whopping 1,372 songs during that time period! </li>
                    <li>Most guitars have 6 strings, but 4 and 12 string guitars are fairly common, and 7, 8, and 10 string guitars are rare but exist. Guitar strings today are made from either steel or nylon, but used to be made from animal intestines. </li>
                    <li>The first electrically amplified guitar was invented by musician George Beauchamp and electric engineer Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931. An electric guitar utilizes electromagnetic radiation to convert vibrations of its metal strings into electric signals. </li>
                    <li>Jimi Hendrix, widely considered the most famous and influential guitarist of all-time, played a right-handed guitar upside down and strung in reverse, because he was left-handed. He even played guitar with his teeth and behind his back!</li>

                  <ul class="u-text u-text-4">
                    <li> The piano was invented in Italy in 1709 by Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori.</li>
                    <li>The piano was originally called the pianoforte because of its ability to play notes both quietly (piano) and loudly (forte). The harpsichords that came before were only able to play softly.</li>
                    <li>The piano has over 12,000 parts, 10,000 of which are moving. It is an enormous number of small pieces that need to work perfectly to get the sound that you want out of the instrument.</li>
                    <li>There are 230 strings needed for a piano to make its full range of sound.</li>
                    <li>The strings are made out of steel and produce their sound when struck by tiny hammers inside the piano. Each string usually holds about 170 pounds of tension. This is one of the reasons why piano tuning is a job for a specialist!</li>
                    <li>The piano can be considered both a string instrument and a percussion instrument. Most believe it is percussion because the hammers are striking the strings inside.</li>
                    <li>The range of the piano goes from the lowest note you can play on a double-bassoon to the highest note you can play on a piccolo. That is an entire orchestral range in one instrument!</li>
                    <li>Many people refer to the piano keys as “ivories,” but actually they haven’t been made out of ivory since the 1940’s. They are now made out of plastic to protect endangered resources.</li>
                    <li>The exact middle of a piano keyboard is NOT middle C. It is actually the space between E and F above middle C.</li>
                    <li>What are those pedals at the bottom of the piano for? The pedal on the left is a damper pedal. It moves the hammers closer to the string, which makes the sound softer. The middle pedal is a sostenuto pedal. It sustains only the notes you press, and then allows you to play others without sustain. The right pedal is the sustain pedal and is used the most often.</li>
                    <li>The first piano invented was so expensive that average rich families could not afford. You could only really find these expensive instruments in homes of aristocrats and royalty for nearly a century before it became more accessible to the rest of the public.</li>
                    <li>The largest piano ever made was by Adrian Mann, a piano tuner from New Zealand. It weighs 1.4 tons and is 5.7 meters long. It took this 25-year-old 4 years to build it!</li>
                    <li>There are 18 million non-professional piano players in the US alone!</li>
                    <li>The best piano brand is considered to be Steinway. The Steinway family has been making pianos since 1853!</li>
                    <li>One of Cristofori’s original pianos is still in existence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City!</li>

                  <h3 class="u-text u-text-palette-1-base u-text-1">History</h3>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">History of MusicPre-Renaissance Music: The Evolution of Instruments and TheoryPrehistoric MusicThe earliest forms of music were probably drum-based, percussion instruments being the most readily available at the time (i.e. rocks, sticks). These simplest of simple instruments are thought to have been used in religious ceremonies as representations of animals. There was no notation or writing of this kind of "music" and its sounds can only be extrapolated from the music of (South) American Indians and African natives who still adhere to some of the ancient religious practices.As for the more advanced instruments, their evolution was slow and steady. It is known that by 4000 BCE the Egyptians had created harps and flutes, and by 3500 BCE lyres and double-reeded clarinets had been developed.In Denmark, by 2500 BCE an early form of the trumpet had been developed. This trumpet is what is now known as a "natural trumpet." It is valveless, and depends completely on manipulation of the lips to change pitch.One of the most popular instruments today was created in 1500 BCE by the Hittites. I am talking about the guitar. This was a great step; the use of frets to change the pitch of a vibrating string would lead to later instruments such as the violin and harpsichord.In 800 BCE the first recovered piece of recorded music was found. It was written in cuneiform and was a religious hymn. It should be noted that cuneiform is not a type of musical notation.By 700 BCE there are records of songs that include vocals with instrumentals. This added a whole new dimension to music: accompaniment.Music in Ancient Rome and GreeceGreece was the root of all Classical art, so it's no coincidence that Classical music is rooted in Grecian innovations. In 600 BCE, famed mathematician Pythagorus dissected music as a science and developed the keystone of modern music: the octave scale. The importance of this event is obvious. Music was a passion of the Greeks. With their surplus of leisure time (thanks to slave labor) they were able to cultivate great artistic skills. Trumpet competitions were common spectator events in Greece by 400 BCE. It was in Greece that the first bricks in music theory's foundation were layed. Aristotle wrote on music theory scientifically, and brought about a method of notation in 350 BCE. The work of that genius is still studied today.The next significant step in music's evolution was by Boethius. In 521 CE he brought the Greek system of notation to Western Europe, allowing the musicians there to scribe accurately the folk songs of their lands. Incidentally, it was Boethius who first wrote on the idea of the opera.Music in the Middle AgesMost of the music created after Rome fell was commissioned by the church. The Catholic religion has a long history of involvement (for better or worse) with the musical arts. In 600 CE Pope Gregory had the Schola Cantarum built. This was the first music school in Europe.Meanwhile in China, music was progressing also: it was reported that in 612 CE there were orchestras with hundreds of musicians performing for the assorted dynasties. Although the specific music from this period in China is unknown, the distinct style supposed to have developed there is reflected even in recent orchestral Asiatic pieces.In 650 CE a new system of writing music was developed using "neumes" as a notation for groups of notes in music.144 years after the Schola Cantarum was built, a singing school opened in the Monastery of Fuda, fueling the interest in musical vocation. And by 790 CE, there were splinters of the Schola Cantarum in Paris, Cologne and Metz. In 800 CE the great unifier Charlemagne had poems and psalms set to music. In 850 CE Catholic musicians had a breakthrough by inventing the church "modes." These modes would later metamorphose into today's major and minor scales. In 855 CE, the first polyphonic (2 unrelated melodies/voices at once) piece was recorded, and by 1056 this polyphonic style replaced Gregorian chants as the music of choice (even after the Church made polyphonic music "illegal"; this ban was later lifted). In 980 CE, the great tome Antiphononium Codex Montpellier was scribed.In 1000 CE Guido D'Arezzo made many improvements in music theory. He first improved and reworked standard notation to be more user-friendly by adding time signatures. Then he invented solfege. This is the vocal note scale: do, re, mi, fa, so, la ,ti, do. This innovation has affected almost every modern vocalist.In 1100 CE, a new secular movement began. This separation of Church from music was a straddling one, and soon this new "folk" music was looked down upon as pagan and borderline blasphemous.The RenaissanceOn the dawn of the Renaissance in 1465 the printing press was first used to print music. By using a press a composer could organize his pieces and profit from them with great ease. In 1490 Boethius's writings on opera were republished in Italian.With the onset of the Renaissance, the rules of music were about to change drastically. This was the beginning of a new enlightened age that would showcase some of the greatest musical minds ever produced.</p>

                  <h3 class="u-align-center u-text u-text-palette-1-base u-text-3">The Future</h3>
                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-4">AI IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY: MAJOR OR MINOR IMPROVEMENT? <br>The music industry at large is not immune to the growing presence of AI in the general workforce. <br>
                    <br>True to the “augment vs. replace” distinction, it is expected that music producer and songwriter jobs will be augmented, rather than outright replaced, as AI continues to integrate into the creative process. <br>
                    <br>AI technologies and applications have become significantly more popular and capable, increasing data volumes and advancing algorithms while providing improvements in computing power and storage, all commodities that music creators need. <br>
                    <br>While innovations in how we create music and how it is consumed are indeed exciting, as a creator, one must be wary of completely removing the human element out of art. Because, naturally, all art forms are, by definition, human. <br>
                    <br>Music is littered with notions of subjectivity and taste; it’s a transaction with emotional currency, so it is difficult to wrap my head around a computer being able to tap into the creative process, as well as the intellectual components that make great music resonate. <br>
                    <br>In Bicentennial Man, they had to make Robin Williams fully human before he could really be human. I think this says a lot about AI’s role in music and the arts in general. <br>
                    <br>Below, I outline several innovations in the world of AI in music, and speak to a few pros and cons that I’ve observed. <br>
                    <br>Streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music rely on AI to deliver personalized playlists. <br>AI = THE NEW MUSICIAN? <br>Over the last several decades, there are numerous examples of musicians using AI-generated methods like neural networks to fuel the creative process and augment music composition. These have run the gamut from more boutique, “techy” offerings, to Billboard-charting singles. <br>
                    <br>In 2016, super producer Alex da Kid released the song “Not Easy,” a collaboration with X-Ambassadors, Elle King, Wiz Khalifa and…IBM’s computer system, “Watson.” Said Rolling Stone, “Watson…presented five years of analyzed cultural data in a way that meant something to Alex: through colors, patterns, textures, and words, Alex was able to read the data in a customized way – a data visualization made up of colors, words, patterns, and textures – that moved him.” <br>
                    <br>In 2017, American Idol alum Taryn Southern released I AM AI, an album that’s music was composed entirely by an AI composition program from Amper Music that used internal algorithms to produce melodies that blended appropriately with a particular mood and genre. <br>
                    <br>In 2019, Björk and Microsoft partnered with New York City’s Sister City Hotel, using AI to adapt in real-time based on sunrises, sunsets, and changes in barometric pressure, triggered via a live camera feed from the hotel’s roof. <br>
                    <br>Called Kórsafan, Microsoft’s AI uses sounds from Björk’s personal archive to create endless variations of music to set a weather-based mood for hotel guests. Moreover, the AI-generated system is trained to recognize different types of clouds, snow, rain, clear sky, and birds in different lighting and seasons. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>So, as you can see, there are some pretty groundbreaking innovations in the world of music-driven AI. But in these examples, the AI is being assisted by humans virtually every step of the way. So don’t expect pop songs written entirely by AI any time soon. <br>
                    <br>(However, if you want a taste of the future, you can listen to the album Auxuman created entirely with AI.) <br>
                    <br>”Is AI *capable* of artistic songwriting?  This is a philosophical debate for the ages, but it really comes down to how you define art.  I can’t do justice to that debate in full, but think about the following simplification.  If we define art as (in part) the expression of the emotion of the artist, we will have a hard time defending that AI could possibly create art.  That would require that we accept that the AI can have emotion.  On the other hand, if instead we define art as evoking emotion in the listener–in an orchestrated way, rather than by random chance–then yes, AI certainly has the opportunity, and probably not in the distant future.  It is completely conceivable that a machine learning system could learn how different musical compositions, techniques, and devices affect the emotion of listeners, and then have a system that composes music with the *purpose* of evoking certain emotions.” – Foster Provost, Professor of Entrepreneurship, Data Science, and Information Systems and Director at Stern School of Business at New York University. <br>
                    <br>THE “UNCANNY VALLEY” <br>The biggest point of contention in all of this is whether or not AI rejects what makes music “music”: humanity. <br>
                    <br>Many musicians and creatives empathize with those who argue that “computer music” could never emulate the human touch of an actual musician, that the “expressionism of music” is too sacred to impart onto technology. For some, the very thought of computers generating music from an algorithm, rather than being woodshedded by an artist, seems like heresy. <br>
                    <br>It’s so dangerously close to being human that it evokes feelings of abject horror (enter, the phenomena of the uncanny valley). <br>
                    <br>EXAMPLES OF AI IN MUSIC <br>AI CASE STUDY #1: SHAZAM <br>Perhaps one of the most stunning innovations in the world of artificial intelligence is one that sits neatly on our phones: Shazam. <br>
                    <br>One of the first consumer-adopted artificial intelligence services, Shazam uses intelligent technology to listen to and then identify songs, all in a matter of seconds. How many times have you been to a bar or restaurant and seen someone randomly holding up their arm with their phone in their hand, or even standing on a chair to get it closer to a speaker? <br>
                    <br>Partnering with Apple Music, Shazam does the equivalent of a fingerprint or retina scan on a piece of music. It matches that scan to the Apple Music library and swiftly comes up with the song. The song is then automatically added to the user’s Apple Music library under the pre-made “My Shazam Tracks” playlist. <br>
                    <br>I can’t tell you the number of times I have been watching television shows like The O.C., Shameless, Bojack Horseman or Insecure and thought, “Wow! That’s a great song! I wonder what that is?!” then held my phone to the TV and voila! there it is, loaded onto my phone ready for listening. <br>
                    <br>Shazam’s service provides an incredible amount of consumer satisfaction, and it very well may be my favorite piece of artificial intelligence technology that exists. <br>
                    <br>AI CASE STUDY #2: MUSIC STREAMING SERVICES &amp; PLAYLISTING <br>spotify discover weekly data flow diagram <br>
                    <br>We can’t discuss AI music without discussing the music streaming giants. It’s this generation’s “Coke or Pepsi.” Streaming services are now the dominant force in all aspects of music, overtaking digital downloads as the next big thing. <br>
                    <br>Apple has been slowly killing off its iTunes service for the last several years, Google folded its Google Play service into the YouTube Music streaming service and Amazon has been putting more stock into its Amazon Music streaming service over digital downloads. <br>
                    <br>If you are an artist trying to gain some clout, independent or otherwise, getting your song onto an official Spotify or Apple Music playlist has become the holy grail of promotional gambits. In recent years, independent artists looked to blogs and other publications to increase their buzz, but now those days are gone and it’s all about playlisting. <br>
                    <br>And if you thought having high numbers on social networks like Instagram and Facebook were important, Spotify even has your music streaming data front-and-center for industry professionals to examine. <br>
                    <br>While Spotify and Apple Music playlists can hold the key to generating buzz in a crowded 2021 musical landscape, they also are a testament to AI’s integration into how we consume music. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>Spotify’s bread-and-butter is their “Discover Weekly” playlists. These are generated for users based on an algorithm that reacts to a user’s listening history and creates a playlist highlighting their tastes, as well as new music that the algorithm thinks they will like. <br>
                    <br>Spotify’s artificial intelligence undergoes ongoing improvements by collecting as much listening data as possible, performing a comparative analysis from other users, and then uses these results to suggest new music. <br>
                    <br>Apple Music is different because, as it claims, their playlists are strictly curated by an expert curation team. Additionally, one of Apple’s flagship services is Apple Music 1 Radio – formerly Beats 1 Radio – which is a 24-hour radio service that is curated and hosted by actual DJs and celebrity hosts. <br>
                    <br>Despite the convenience of Spotify’s machine learning/algorithm-centric playlists, Apple Music’s human curation provides a personal touch to the music discovery process. Additionally, Apple Music will inform playlist subscribers when a playlist has been updated with new music. <br>
                    <br>So where do I fall on this? Personally, I subscribe to both Apple Music and Spotify and feel that both have their strengths and weaknesses. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>See Also <br>OVERCOME MUSICIAN’S BLOCK (5 SCIENCE-BACKED TACTICS THAT WORK) <br>
                    <br>When it comes to the AI components, sure, an algorithm based on a title, keyword, genre, etc. can come up with a good playlist, but when a human acts as a curator, as opposed to a computer, they can better understand the feelings behind the music. <br>
                    <br>Behind the running order. Behind the sonic zigs and zags. The way a lyric can change the way someone feels about a song, or the way an outro of one song can make you want to hear the complimentary intro of another song. <br>
                    <br>This somewhat resembles the old “mixtape” days of literal tapes, burned CDs, or just making a playlist for someone you know. <br>
                    <br>” ‘Artificial Intelligence’ and ‘Machine Learning’  are buzzwords for a type of software that is ultimately experiential: what goes into AI represents collective information but not necessarily innovation. It is one reason why AI is very good at identifying what you like based upon your interests, but why at the same time what it produces – in art, in music, in writing – tends to be bland and uninspiring. Musicians should see it as a tool, but like any tool, overreliance on AI can become a crutch, because it can drown out the spark of what makes art original … you.”  – Kurt Cagle, Community Editor, Data Science Central. <br>
                    <br>AI CASE STUDY #3: LANDR <br>The final area I would like to particularly focus on is artificial intelligence in music production. AI audio mastering services are beginning to seize major market share from traditional mastering engineers, with the major player being LANDR. But to better understand this competition, we need to answer a simple question: what exactly is mastering? <br>
                    <br>Mastering makes your completed music sound professional, balanced, cohesive, and competitive for commercial release, while ensuring that it maintains the same level of quality across a wide variety of speaker systems and media formats. <br>
                    <br>This is done through the following processes, via Icon Collective: <br>
                    <br>Emphasizing or reducing certain frequencies <br>Fix phase – out-of-sync soundwave – issues <br>Create an even distribution of frequencies to help dynamic recordings translate on different playback systems, protecting against low-end rumble and harsh high-end <br>Remove pops, clicks, and other unwanted noises from a sound source <br>So how does LANDR work?  Straight from the horse’s mouth, LANDR uses machine learning to replicate the “human intelligence” mastering process through “smart” mastering software that is… <br>
                    <br>“Built around an adaptive engine that ‘listens’ and reacts to music, using micro-genre detection to make subtle frame-by-frame adjustments using tools like multi-band compression, EQ, stereo enhancement, limiting and harmonic saturation, based on the unique properties of your song.” <br>
                    <br>Having the ability to finish a song, then have it mastered in a matter of minutes, all without having to leave your chair or deal with communication channels, various schedules, and invoicing, is pretty amazing. <br>
                    <br>But here’s the thing. No matter how smart LANDR’s software may be, it makes decisions based on algorithms, not emotions or feelings. <br>
                    <br>Inevitably, this can result in just-OK-sounding masters, however, if you are only paying $20/song, can you really be that upset? <br>
                    <br>Mastering engineers, however, can respond on instinct and feeling, can go through several rounds of feedback, while also having the ability to master a full album, complete with consistent loudness levels from track-to-track, fades, etc. <br>
                    <br>AI just can’t match that level of personal intimacy… for now. <br>
                    <br>AI IS HERE TO STAY, BUT ITS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE A GREY AREA <br>So as has been outlined, artificial intelligence is an ever-populating tool that can be utilized in most industries. Its contributions to music composition, production and more, are farther-reaching by the year. <br>

                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">For It’s heart healthy.&nbsp;</span>Research has shown that blood flows more easily when music is played. It can also reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, decrease cortisol (stress hormone) levels and increase serotonin and endorphin levels in the blood.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It elevates mood.&nbsp;</span>Music can boost the brain’s production of the hormone dopamine. This increased dopamine production helps relieve feelings of anxiety and depression. Music is processed directly by the amygdala, which is the part of the brain involved in mood and emotions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It reduces stress.&nbsp;</span>Research has found that listening to music can relieve stress by triggering biochemical stress reducers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It relieves symptoms of depression.&nbsp;</span>When you’re feeling down in the dumps, music can help pick you up - much like exercise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It stimulates memories.&nbsp;</span>There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease or dementia but music therapy has been shown to relieve some of its symptoms. Music therapy can relax an agitated patient, improve the mood and open communication in patients.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It manages pain.</span> By reducing stress levels and providing a strong competing stimulus to the pain signals that enter the brain, music therapy can assist in pain management.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It eases pain.&nbsp;</span>Music can meaningfully reduce the perceived intensity of pain, especially in geriatric care, intensive care or palliative medicine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It helps people eat less.&nbsp;</span>Playing soft music in the background (and dimming the lights) during a meal can help people slow down while eating and ultimately consume less food in one sitting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <span style="font-weight: 700;">It increases workout endurance</span>. Listening to those top workout tracks can boost physical performance and increase endurance during a tough exercise session.
